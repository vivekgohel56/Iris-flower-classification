# Iris-flower-classification
I had taken this project from https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

In this we will try all algorithm. we dont know which algorithm is best and give high accuracy. After seeing the acuracy score of all algorithm we see that SVM gives high accuracy so we will use this algorithm in our model.
